### Updates

**Version 0.6.0**

Added a task list button and the prototype for what the task list will look like when the button is clicked. Additionally, made modifications to the color theme toggle when breaks are started and ended. Now, the VS Code theme will invert its "kind" value when a break is toggled, effectively switching the theme regardless of what the user has set. This ensures that there will be a noticible difference when a theme is toggled. 

**Version 0.5.1**

Started creating the timer. Added buttons and functionality behind the buttons to start/pause the timer, reset the timer, skip the current break, and snooze (add 5 minutes to the running timer). Additionally, started working on a "non-intrusive" way to show whether the timer is on "break time" (switch to light theme) or on "running time" (switch to dark theme).

**Version 0.1**

First iteration of the VS-Saturn extension. Simply uses Microsoft's VS Code API to output two different types of messages to the screen: a basic text message and an alert message.
